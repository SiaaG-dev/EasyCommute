# EasyCommute

EasyCommute allows commuters to find the nearest bus stop, attractions, real-time weather information, weather pop-ups and display, and the shortest path using our Linux Based Map for any Country. Map is based on a linux based system using EZGL, Glade, and GTK as the front end and C++ (Visual studio code for the backend).
